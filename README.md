- REACT
- REACT DND (https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about)
React DnD is a set of React utilities to help you build complex drag and drop interfaces while keeping your components decoupled. It is a perfect fit for apps like Trello and Storify, where dragging transfers data between different parts of the application, and the components change their appearance and the application state in response to the drag and drop events.
